# Results from learning about Ontologies

Did the Protégé OWL Tutorial and this repo is just to take some notes and stuff.

## The Tutorial
The file `ProtegeOWLTutorialP4_v1_3.pdf` was taken from [OWL@Manchester](http://owl.cs.manchester.ac.uk/publications/talks-and-tutorials/protg-owl-tutorial/) ([Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 3.0 Unported License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/); initially written by Matthew Horridge).

## The Notes
The file `ontologies.mm` encodes a mindmap with notes about ontologies. Feel free to extend and correct it. It was created using [freeplane](http://freeplane.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) (version 1.3.12-1 from the debian repository).

## The Ontology
The ontology `pizza.owl` was created from the tutorial using [Protégé 5.0.0-beta-15](http://protege.stanford.edu/).

## Next
Feel free to fork and extend. If you find an error or have further information I'd be happy to hear about that. The files I created are licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).
